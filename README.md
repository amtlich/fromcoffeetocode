# From Coffee to Code ☕ ➜ 💻

This small Python project is a personal milestone:
I went from pouring latte art Christmas trees as a professional barista
to rendering Christmas trees in a terminal with Python.

## What it does

- Renders an ASCII Christmas tree in the terminal  
- Highlights ornaments in different colors using ANSI escape codes  
- Provides two animation modes:
  - **Color cycle** – one color at a time  
  - **Twinkle** – ornaments randomly blinking in different colors  

## How to run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amtlich/fromcoffeetocode.git
cd fromcoffeetocode
python xmastree.py
